# Code Quest: The Digital Adventure

## Project Overview
**Code Quest: The Digital Adventure** is an interactive, browser-based educational game designed to teach fundamental programming concepts to beginners of all ages. Through a fun, story-driven adventure, players learn about variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and arrays by making choices and solving coding challenges. The project aims to make learning programming approachable, engaging, and memorable for students, self-learners, and anyone curious about coding.

## Features

  1. Variables
  2. Loops
  3. Functions
  4. Conditionals
  5. Arrays
- Interactive choices and instant feedback
- Progress tracking and a celebratory completion screen
- Beautiful, modern UI
